# Three-Body-Jacobi
Matrix elements of chiral 3N interactions under JJ-coupled three-body partial-wave basis, written in C++.

## Method
To do partial-wave projection for 3N interactions, we follow the "aPWD" method developed by J. Golak (see "A new way to perform partial wave decompositions of few-nucleon forces").
Unlike the description in the original paper, we perform the partial-wave decomposition under JJ-coupled 3N states (usually denoted by $\alpha$). But the formalism is almost the same.

The codes will be submmited recent days.
