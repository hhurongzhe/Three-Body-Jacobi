# Three-Body-Jacobi

Calculating matrix elements of chiral 3N interactions under JJ-coupled three-body partial-wave basis ( in Jacobi coordinates ), written in C++.



## Requirements

A C++ compiler with a makefile would be enough.

However, I use Xmake, which is a lightweight and fast building utility based on lua.



## Method

To do partial-wave projection for 3N interactions, we follow the "aPWD" method developed by J. Golak ( see "A new way to perform partial wave decompositions of few-nucleon forces" ). Unlike the description in the original paper, we perform partial-wave decomposition under JJ-coupled 3N states directly ( usually denoted by $\ket{\alpha}$ ). But the formalism is almost the same.



## Structure of Code

- src/constants.hpp: definitions of LECs, mesh points and other things. You may need to change these for your use.
- src/precalculate.hpp: some functions and structures used to precalculate and store in the beginning of calculation. This is necessary for speeding up the code.
- src/aPWD3.hpp: doing partial-wave decomposition for 3N force under JJ-coupled states. This file is rather big because we generate it by Mathematica.
- src/main.hpp: the main function, doing angular integration and calculating in specific channels.
- tools/*.py: some simple python tools to generate mesh points, channels index and some other things useful.
- apwd3.py: a simple and direct code to do above things using python. This is just a template code for check, running very slow.
- xmake.lua: Xmakeâ€™s project description file.



## Remarks

This code is mainly designed for generating non-locally regulated 3N interaction in the Jacobi coordinate (up to N2LO). However, it is possible to extend for local 3N interaction or for N3LO terms.
